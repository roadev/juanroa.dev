Maybe many of you didn't know that Apple has open-sourced its Swift 2 code (compiler and core-libraries too) under the MIT license the past december (2015).

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
  @text.hi = "hi#{hi} #{hi}"
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
