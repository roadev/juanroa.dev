I’m sure that many of you have wondered if C programming in the Arduino’s official IDE is the only way to program on it. The answer is: not!

There are more alternatives to work in arduino and other programming languages such: [Go lang][gobot], Ruby and [Javascript][cylonjs].

At this time, I'll explain how to get started with the Artoo Ruby Framework. It's a framework that supports up to 15 different platforms (Arduino, ARDrone Sphero, Raspberry PI and others).
