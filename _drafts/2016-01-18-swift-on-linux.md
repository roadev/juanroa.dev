Maybe many of you didn't know that Apple has open-sourced its Swift 2 code (compiler and core-libraries too) under the MIT license the past december (2015).

I'm going to show you how to install it on your Linux System (Archlinux, Ubuntu and Debian distros) and how to run some
basic examples on the swift shell environment.

{% highlight ruby %}
def show
  @widget = Widget(params[:id])
  respond_to do |format|
  @text.hi = "hi#{hi} #{hi}"
    format.html # show.html.erb
    format.json { render json: @widget }
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
